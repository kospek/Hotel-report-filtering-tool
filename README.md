# Hotel-report-filtering-tool
This tool processes exported files from HOREC hotel property management system.

The goal is to simplify calculation for City Tax based on visitor age and days of stay. This script  filters out only visitors who are older than 15 years and younger than 62 and shows how many nights they were staying at the hotel.

Output file is new filtered xlsx file with only needed columns and rows from the original file.
